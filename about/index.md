# The Century Arcade

## History

In 2012 while Megan was on safari in Africa, to soothe my heartache I played a
game called Below The Root, which I loved playing as a kid.  At the time I
didn't know that it's one of the first graphical adventure games, and
well-loved by many other players too.  I spent too many hours playing it, and
fell in love with it again: this is a quality game, and quite remarkable
considering its time.

I wanted to show Megan this wonderful game when she returned; maybe she'd even
want to play it for a few hours.  So I tried to put together a reasonable
recreation of the Commodore 64 version, which had more colors and polyphonic
sounds.  With all of the technology and open source I had access to, I thought
it would be reasonably straightforward.  Instead it was frustrating and
ultimately pretty disappointing.

The Century Arcade is the result of that frustration.

## Mission

The Century Arcade restores old, bitrotten games, and produces modern
executable images suitable for playing in decades to come.

The Arcade will only distribute images to the public when it is legally allowed
to do so (i.e. when permission has been granted or licensed, or the copyrighted
content has ascended into the public domain).  Until then, the image is stored
in private cloud storage, which is maintained by a prepaid fund.

Released images are deliberately constructed to likely still be functional in
future virtual machines and emulators.

## Want to help?

The process for building images is open and designed to be reasonably easy for
other people to contribute.  You could curate an image of your favorite game,
[beta test unreleased game images](/games), or [help fix a technical issue](/rfh).

## Source 

All components are open source with reasonable licenses.  The scripts and configurations that produce these images are at [github.com/century-arcade/src](github.com/century-arcade/src).
