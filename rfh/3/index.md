## RFH3: Description of the pre-Arcade experience

*2014/1/15*

Wanted:  one technically-savvy person who

* has a fondness for early computer adventure games
* may or may not have used a C64 back in the day
* has not tried to emulate a C64 game before

to figure out how to play Below The Root [C64] and objectively document their
experience, including how much time and technical expertise went into
getting it to work.

Was the game fun once play actually started?

Time required: probably a couple hours total.
